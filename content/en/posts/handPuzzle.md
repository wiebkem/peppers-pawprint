description = "Today I want to introduce the second enrichment - the hand puzzle. The hand puzzle is about the dog touching the hand with his nose or giving his paw and afterwards getting the reward."

To begin with, take one or multiple treats in your right hand and form a fist. The second hand should be flat besides it. Then the dog is allowed to come and smell on the right hand with the treats. As soon as the dog is touching the left hand with the nose, you can open the first to reward the dog.

Especially in the beginning, the dog probably tries to open the fist with the treats. You should ignore this.
As soon as the dog understands to touch the hand, it is possible to place the two hands further away from each other. The distance of the hands should not be too far away, e.g. just a hand width, as the dog has to understand again that he should still touch the flat hand. Once the dog understands the action, the hands can be further moved from each other to increase the difficulty.

Personally, I trained Pepper to touch my left hand, if I have treats in the right hand. If I have treats in the left hand, he gives me his paw in my right hand. Before a dog is able to give a paw, the trick should be learned outside the hand puzzle!

**Inside the family, the actions with the right and left hand should be the same for everyone. It's also possible to always get a nose touch or give the paw with both hands. Just keep in mind to not overdue it on a day so that the dog still has fun.**
