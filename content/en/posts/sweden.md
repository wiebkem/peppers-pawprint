It has always been my dream to live in Sweden for a while and this dream came true for my master’s degree. Pepper and I spent a total of 1.5 years in Sweden.


### Travel
I can only talk about my experiences to travel to Sweden from Germany:
1. You can drive through Denmark and then use the Öresund bridge between Copenhagen and Malmö. This bridge connects the two countries. It is easy to buy the tickets online so you don't have to queue in front of the bridge.
2. A second possibility is the ferry crossing. There are ferries from e.g. Travemünde and Rostock in Germany to Trelleborg or from Kiel in Germany to Gothenburg. The most common ferries are the one from [Stenaline](https://www.stenaline.com/) and [TT-Line](https://www.ttline.com/en/passengers/). These go back and forth every day.  
On the ferry you cannot stay inside the car, but most ferries have their own lounges for dogs.  
Many children run around during the day and it is generally very restless. At night you can sleep on the floor next to your dog if you don't have a pet cabin, and everything is calmer and more relaxed than during the day.  
The ferry takes 6 to 7 hours. The pure crossing is about 6 hours, but you are usually loaded onto the ship a little earlier and it takes a little longer to unload. I always waited at a petrol station or rest area at the ferry port to let the dog out for the last time. After the crossing and unloading all cars, the first resting place was my point of interest to leave out the dog.

Personally, I decided not to travel from Germany to Sweden via Denmark, but to take the ferry. I made this choise as I drove the route alone. Additionally, I prefer the night ferries as I have the opportunity to sleep on the ferry.


### Entry requirements
If you generally travel with your dog to another country, the dog needs a pet passport, a microchip and a valid rabies vaccination. Furthermore, there are no special entry requirements for Sweden.


### National parks
Dogs must be kept on a leash in all national parks in Sweden. This is to protect animals and nature. All information about the national parks can be found on the website [National parks of Sweden](http://www.nationalparksofsweden.se/).
I usually kept Pepper on a long leash in the national parks which is 7.5 meters long. This way he had more freedom to move and was still leashed.


### Free running dogs outside the national parks
The dog must be on a leash in the city area. Nevertheless, the dog is mostly allowed to run free in the forest. To be on the safe side, you should read the information board that says at which time of the year your dog can run freely in the forest.


### Public transport
Dogs can be taken on the public transport free of charge. There are special areas for dogs, which are mostly in the rear compartment, since in this case people with an allergy are protected in the front part. If you pay attention to these areas, it is very easy to use the public transport with your dog.
