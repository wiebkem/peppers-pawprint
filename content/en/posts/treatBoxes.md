Take an egg carton or shipping box and fill it with treats. Especially at the beginning it is probably too difficult for your dog to open the closed box. You can just close the box lightly. This makes it easier for your dog.

Once your dog dares to open the box, you can close the box completely in a later attempt. Just look at your dog and decrease the difficulty accordingly!

Toilet paper or kitchen paper rolls can also be filled with treats - just fold the ends over. However, you should be careful with the roles that your dog does not eat them completely as this could happen in the beginning.

**Have fun with your dog!**
