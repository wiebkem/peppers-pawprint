description = "The Ardennes is a beautiful area for hiking and for enjoying the nature in general. We rented a holiday home in Braibant with two fish ponds and a large fenced garden. From there we then explored the area."

## Domain de Chevetogne
The [Domaine de Chevetogne](http://www.domainedechevetogne.be/) is a nature park with different attractions. In the summer months it is possible to swim or play tennis and kids can play on multiple playgrounds all the year.  
Additionally, the park has different nature walking routes. Dogs are allowed on a leash and in the winter months you can visited the park for free.

## Grotte de Dinant La Merveilleuse
The [Grotte de Dinant La Merveilleuse](https://www.valleedelameuse-tourisme.be/grotte-de-dinant-la-merveilleuse.html?lang=en) is said to be one of the most beautiful caves in Belgium. A guided tour takes about one hour and you are allowed to bring your dog.  
Personally, I have decided to leave Pepper at the holiday home. However, there were two dogs on our tour and this was not an issue. In case you want to take your dog, it should be noted that the dog has to walk quite some stairs.

## Han-Sur-Lesse
In Han-Sur-Lesse there are several beautiful hiking trails from 7.7 km to 41 km from [Trail en Famenne](https://www.famenneardenne.be/en/hades_offre/trail-en-famenne/) which start at the church. These walks are nature trails and lead through the forest as well as a few roads. We only discovered these hikes by accident and searched the internet a lot for a place where we can hike. These routes we can definitely recommend.
