How do you feed your dog? What is right and what is wrong?  
In the beginning, I just fed what most people feed - dry food. I thought this was good for Pepper and didn't think any further about it. This went well for a few years, 5 years to be exact. Then the problems started.

In December 2013, Pepper had an eczema on his tail that was a few centimetres long. For weeks, Pepper hadn't felt well, scratched himself day and night and just couldn't rest. Of course, we also went to the veterinarian a few times. The first time Pepper was treated for fleas, although he clearly had no fleas. After that he was treated with antibiotics and it took about 3 weeks until the eczema was finally gone and Pepper was able to find his peace again.

A new problem started in January 2014. We had just beaten the eczema and Pepper suddenly had diarrhea and vomited. At that time, he was fed once a day in the evening. This meant that I went outside with him every two hours at night because he had such bad diarrhea and had to vomit all the time. Of course, I also checked this with a veterinarian, but it just didn't get any better. As long as he only ate the special diet, everything was fine and we could sleep through the night without problems. But as soon as I added only a handful of dry food, we were out every two hours. Certainly, this was not a condition that could go on permanently. Within a week, he had already lost 1.5 kg of weight. At the time, I was looking for alternatives to dry foot and came across BARF.

Straight away, I started with BARF and Pepper was able to digest it. After a few weeks I discovered the Prey Model Raw concept. This appealed to me even more, because in this concept there are no vegetables or other additives. Pepper did not like the vegetables when we BARFed and had eaten them with reluctance. Within a couple of weeks, we switched directly from BARF to Prey Model Raw and have been really happy with this decision ever since. After 6 years we can say that we won't change and have found our diet.


## Prey Model Raw Concept
The Prey Model Raw (PMR) concept is based on whole prey without any vegetable ingredients. If there is no way to feed whole prey, this is compiled based on the following breakdown:
+ 80% Meat including fat
+ 10% Bones
+ 5% Liver
+ 5% Other organs such as spleen or kidney

Pepper gets 3% of his ideal body weight. Young dogs might be fed between 5-6% of the body weight, because they have an increased need during their growth.

### Meat
Meat is available from various animals. It is important to feed at least two (but preferably three) different types of red meat, e.g. beef, horse, sheep, lamb or goat. White meat should not be fed primarily (e.g. chicken, turkey, goose, etc.).  
In general, the meat should have a fat content of 15-25% for the reason that fat provides the dog with important energy. If the meat has a low-fat content, it is important to add extra fat.  
I also feed the meat in large pieces, as this comes closest to a prey animal and in addition, the dog has to chew.

### Bones
Bones should always be fed with a lot of meat around it. The meat around the bones must then be subtracted from the 10% bones and added to the 80% meat. The 10% bones are therefore only the pure amount of bones.  
For example, chicken necks have around 50% bones. To get the 10% pure bone amount, more than 10% of chicken necks have to be fed. The meat around the chicken necks is then deducted from the amount of bones and this meat portion is added to the amount of meat.  
It is also important not to feed supporting bones as they are too hard for the dog and could injure him.

### Fish oil
Unless grass-fed or wild animals are mainly fed, it is important to add fish oil to the diet. Mast meat has too much omega-6 which must be balanced with the omega-3 in fish oil. Too much omega-6 can cause inflammation in the dog's body.
