Pepper is now 11 years old and we have never lived at the same address for longer than 2 years and 2 months. Personally, we have tried many different living situations and would like to share our experiences with advantages and disadvantages.

## House with enclosed garden
When Pepper moved in with us, I was still living at home with my family in a house with a fenced garden. I think a garden is very practical, because you can just leave the patio door open in summer. This was often the case with us and Pepper could decide for himself whether he would rather lie in the garden or in the house. A fenced garden ensures that the dog cannot run away and that you do not have to be constantly in the garden with the dog. This always gave me peace of mind and I could e.g. cook while the dog relaxes on the grass.

## Apartment without balcony
When I moved out of the house to study, Pepper and I relocated to a student apartment without a balcony and garden on the 1st floor. This was in a different city than my university as I had only found an apartment with a dog there. In this apartment I had a flat mate in the first year and a second flat mate joined in the second year.  
Pepper had no problem with the missing garden or balcony. We went regularly for a walk outside and he had enough enrichment so that he rested in the apartment.  
The only downside to this apartment was that it hadn't an elevator. Since Pepper was still young and I knew I wouldn't be spending many years there, it was fine. However, if you are looking for an apartment for a long time and your dog is no longer the youngest, I definitely recommend an elevator!  
At the time we were living in the apartment, Pepper was injured and needed surgery. We got him back home after the operation, but he still couldn't walk alone. Without an elevator it was hell to get Pepper up to the first floor. Back then we carried him with two people, but a 35kg dog is very heavy! Luckily, he was able to walk again in the evening and, with my help, could walk down the stairs very well.

## Student house with direct garden connection
After two years I had the opportunity to move to my student city with a dog. I had found a room with a direct and only garden connection in a house. I lived in this house with three other flat mates. These rarely had the need to go into the garden and therefore Pepper and I mostly had the garden to ourselves. The garden was high fenced and enclosed on one side by another wall.  
One summer night it was so warm that I opened the garden door so that we could both sleep again. Pepper then spent a very relaxed night on the grass and I was able to sleep again thanks to the cooler air. I only did this because I knew that Pepper couldn't escape from the garden at night. He also had the opportunity to come back in all the time. However, he enjoyed sleeping outside and didn't come back inside until 7 a.m.  
Over all the years, we have lived for the longest time in this house.

## Student house with a fenced garden
After 2 years and 2 months we moved to another student house with a garden. We only had 2 roommates there, but they were different. The atmosphere was a bit more like a family and my roommates also took Pepper into the garden when I was not there. For safety reasons, I would not have allowed this if the garden had not been fenced. For Pepper himself it was totally nice to go into the garden with my roommates.

## Student apartment with balcony
After three years with a garden, we moved back to an apartment. I had a roommate in this apartment and there was a balcony. This apartment was on the 2nd floor and there was an elevator.  
I used the elevator regularly to protect Pepper's joints, since he was already 8 years old at the time. I have to say that Pepper had no problem with the elevator from the start. If there were opportunities to use the elevator before, we had already used it, but it was never a problem.  
He only used the balcony in this apartment when we were on the balcony ourselves. In general, there was nothing important or interesting for him to explore.  
With the move to this apartment, our walks have also changed. We no longer had the opportunity to get into the forest directly from the apartment as we lived in the second largest city in Sweden. From then on I regularly drove with Pepper into the forest for long walks. Since it got dark early in winter, I then went on long walks in the weekend and stayed close to the apartment during the week. There were e.g. green areas or smaller meadows and I have been doing dummy training or other enrichments with Pepper. Since he was busy enough out here, it was no problem for him not to have a garden.

## Studio without a balcony
After 9 months my wish to live alone without roommates was possible and we moved to a studio without a balcony on the 7th floor with an elevator. This studio had an 18sqm room with an integrated kitchenette and a small bathroom. In the small hallway that led into the room and the bathroom, there was a built-in wardrobe and space for jackets and shoes.  
To make the most of the space in the room, I put a loft bed in the studio. The bed itself was only 1.50m high, but provided enough space for some storage space and Pepper's blanket. In the rest of the room I had a folding desk and folding chairs for guests. Thanks to the folding option, I could simply put the pieces of furniture to one side when I didn't need them and thus had more space again.  
Of course there wasn't as much space in the studio as there would have been in a house. For Pepper, it was only important that we were together. Personally, I was much calmer because I could do everything the way I wanted and I didn't have to be consider other flat mates. This calmness was also transferred to Pepper.  
The studio was in a student complex. In front of the house there was a grill corner in the grass with seating. I used it for reading on warmer days while Pepper was lying in the grass. We also had a small park in front of the door. Here we took our shorter walks and for the long walks we continued to drive into the forest by car.

## Apartment with balcony
At the moment Pepper and I live with my boyfriend in an apartment on the 1st floor with a balcony and elevator. There are enough green areas and smaller meadows in the area. For longer walks with free running I use the car and we drive into the forest.  
I use the elevator every day now and only occasionally use the stairs. Pepper also has stiff days at his age or limps more often. The elevator makes it easier for him and is also gentler on his joints. I am very happy that we have one, even if we only live on the first floor.  
It was very hot last summer. We often left the balcony door open overnight. Pepper took advantage of this and stayed outside on the cold concrete. He had the opportunity to come back inside all the time, but he clearly enjoyed the cool night. He only came back to the overheated apartment in the morning. Unfortunately, our apartment didn't cool down overnight, but at least the dog was able to sleep relaxed and cool.

## Conclusion
I think that most dogs can cope with many living conditions. It is not important whether you live in an apartment with a balcony, a house with a garden or a small studio. It is only important to exercise the dog mentally and physically. With sufficient enrichment, the dog doesn't need much space in the house / apartment itself and this becomes a place of rest.  
For an apartment, I can still recommend an elevator. If you have a small dog that you can carry, it is certainly not a problem to get by without an elevator. However, if your dog is taller and heavier, an elevator in old age or after an operation is very helpful!  

**Certainly, there are exceptions!** For dogs that have lived a lot and almost exclusively outside with a previous owner, it is probably more difficult for them to live in a household. If you have a garden then, moving and settling in will make it a lot easier for the dog.  
But there are also other dogs who like to be outdoors a lot and a garden is therefore essential. I would always decide this individually and would not immediately exclude entire dog breeds to live in an apartment.
