Currently, I am following an education as a dog instructor in the Netherlands. We have 12 lessons including theory and practice as well as additional material that we have to learn for the final exam.  

As practicalÂ lessons can only give a first insight into the real lessons with clients, we also have to follow an internship at an acknowledged dog school for at least 3 months. Based on this internship, we have to write an essay about what we learned and what was different based on the learned theory.
