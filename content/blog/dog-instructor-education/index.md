Currently, I am following an education as a dog instructor in the Netherlands. We have 12 lessons including theory and practice as well as additional material that we have to learn for the final exam.  

As practicalÂ lessons can only give a first insight into the real lessons with clients, we also have to follow an internship at an acknowledged dog school for at least 3 months. Based on this internship, we have to write an essay about what we learned and what was different based on the learned theory.

I follow the dog instructor training at Kynotrain in the Netherlands. In total there are 12 lessons spread over 12 months. In the meantime, the intention is to apply what you have learned during the internship at a recognized dog school.

There are no dogs present during the theory lessons. For the practical lessons, the group is asked who has the opportunity to bring a dog and carry out various exercises in groups.

Pepper isn't joining for the practical lessons. Due to his older age, he is no longer suitable for it and he stays at home with my boyfriend.
