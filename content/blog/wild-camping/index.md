description = "Exactly 2 years ago I was wild camping in Sweden. I was alone with Pepper, my car and the camping gear. At that time, we still lived in Gothenburg, could start directly from there and were on the road for about a week."

During the vacation week, we were at the Falun pit and saw the beautiful nature of the 3 national parks: Tresticklan, Fulufjället and Färnebofjärden. We did little hikes almost every day. Since it was very hot at the time of our tour, we were unfortunately unable to take long hikes. Some days we just rested at a lake - Pepper was sleeping and I read a book.  

## Practical things
During wild camping, every place should be left as you found it. I always took all the garbage back in my car and disposed it at the next opportunity.  

Your own water consumption for cooking, drinking, etc. should not be underestimated. I had several water bottles (about 5 litres in total) with me and refilled them regularly, because I didn't want to use disposable bottles. Next time I will definitely buy a canister. This makes sense and is easier to be refilled as well.  

Showering was not possible at the time. I washed myself regularly and also went to a stream or lake to wash myself without soap. Before the trip, I already got used to colder showers. Since there is no warm water for showering during wild camping, I wanted to be prepared for the cold streams. After a few days, I visited a friend and the first warm shower was really good!

## Safety
I think security plays a very important role in wild camping. Not every place is safe and a tent cannot be locked. Without Pepper I would definitely not have gone out for the trip all alone!

**I always kept a very important rule when wild camping: only stay there where you feel good and safe!**

One day I sat at a lake. There was no one around me and I had planned to spend the night there. At 7 p.m. a man came by on a bicycle and started digging in a whole with a shovel. I found this very strange and didn't feel comfortable with it. I then decided to go somewhere else. The man had explained to me that he only digs for earthworms for fishing. Nevertheless, I found his behaviour strange and it was more comfortable for me to continue driving. Unfortunately, I didn't find such a nice place that evening and was only able to set up my tent again at 9 p.m. But it was important to me to feel comfortable and safe in the place if I wanted to sleep there alone with Pepper in the tent.

## Finding a campsite
In Sweden there is a rule that you can camp at least a few hundred meters from a house. I have always looked for a place where I don't bother anyone and, if possible, could not be viewed directly. We could actually find a good place every evening.  

In the beginning we just sat down and I read a book. During meal time all, other camping things came along and finally I set up the tent. Before I went to sleep, I always put all my things back in the car. In that case, nothing could get wet overnight, I didn't attract any wildlife with food and everything was safely stowed away.
