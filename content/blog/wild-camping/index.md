I was alone with Pepper, my car and the camping gear. At that time, we still lived in Gothenburg and could start directly from there.

We were on the road for about a week and visited 3 national parks: Tresticklan, Fulufj채llet and F채rnebofj채rden. Furthermore, we were at the Transtrandsfj채llen.  

Almost every day, we did little hikes. It was very hot at the time of our tour. Therefore, we could not go on long hikes. Some days we just rested by a lake - Pepper was sleeping and I was reading a book.
