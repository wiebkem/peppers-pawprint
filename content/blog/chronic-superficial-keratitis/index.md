description = "Pepper was diagnosed with chronic superficial keratitis two years ago. What exactly is it and can the disease be cured?"
+++

At the time, I thought Pepper had a normal eye infection. Both eyes were red in the outer corner. I went to the vet and had his eyes examined. First of all, we received a normal ointment for eye infections. After a week it wasn't better and we went to the vet again. He re-examined the eye and suspected chronic superficial keratitis.  

The chronic superficial keratitis disease can be diagnosed by an eye test. Nevertheless, our vet advised us to try a second eye ointment. In this way, the disease is diagnosed based on an elimination procedure.  

## What is a chronic superficial keratitis?
The disease is also called pannus and is "a chronic inflammation of the cornea and sclera of the eye that affects dogs" (Faythe Ferone, 2019).  

"The cardinal sign of pannus is vascular or pigment infiltration into the clear cornea, causing whitish, pink or brown discoloration. This typically starts at the outside edge of the clear cornea nearest to the ear and extends inward. The blood vessel in-growth and pigmentation of the cornea may progress across the entire corneal surface and if left untreated, may result in blindness." (Eye Care for Animals, n.d.)

## Can a chronic superficial keratitis be cured?
The disease cannot be cured and the dog must be treated throughout his life. In the beginning, Pepper received special eye ointment twice a day. Both eyes got better and we could slowly change the amount to once a day and then every two days.  

The special eye ointment we use costs about â‚¬ 40 for 3.5g. It is expensive, but the ointment is also very efficient as only a little is dripped into the eyes. As Pepper only gets the ointment every 2 days, we can use it for about 1.5 months.  

## Pepper's condition
Currently, we have a good grip on the disease. Last winter, the eyes were redder in the outer corner of the eye. Now we are heading for summer again and I notice that the eyes are getting better. In general, it is important that the eye ointment is applied regularly.  

The vet recently raised the suspicion of a cataract because Pepper's eyes are very cloudy. In general, it is difficult to determine if there is a cataract and if it may have been caused by the chronic superficial keratitis. However, it doesn't matter because both diseases cannot be cured. In addition, I can already see from certain actions that Pepper loses sight and can no longer see everything. However, at 11 years old I don't think this is a disaster and we will get along with it.
