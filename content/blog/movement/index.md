## What walking speed does my dog have?
I think it's important to look out for your own dog. I have seen puppies being pulled behind their owners with a taut leash. The dog was simply unable to keep up with the owner's walking speed.  
Of course, the same goes for old dogs. Last year, I had a faster walking speed with Pepper than today. The same round that we were able to walk relaxed within 20 minutes lasts 30-40 minutes today. Pepper just walks slower in general and also takes a lot more time to sniff around.  

Sometimes it happens to me too that I walk too fast for Pepper. I then realize that he can no longer walk relaxed and I slow down again. Something like that can of course happen, but it shouldn't be permanent!  

**In general, it is about paying attention to your dog and looking at which walking speed is comfortable for your dog. Your dog shouldn't have to run behind you with a taut leash, instead he should be able to walk relaxed. Note that the pleasant walking speed for your dog isnâ€™t automatically your own preferred walking speed, e.g. when you are walking without your dog!**

## Taking a break during the walk
When I go for a walk with Pepper, we take breaks of different lengths in between. It's really good to just sit in the grass with your dog, watch the environment together, and relax. The dog learns that it is also possible to relax outside. This can e.g. be an advantage if you meet someone you know, want to chat for a few minutes and your dog can then simply lie down and relax.  

Often, our dogs are used to being "on" the whole time during a walk and cannot simply relax next to you on a leash. Therefore, it makes sense to practice taking a break during a walk.
