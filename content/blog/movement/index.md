## What walking speed does my dog have?
I think it's important to look out for your own dog. I have seen puppies being pulled behind their owners with a taut leash. The dog was simply unable to keep up with the owner's walking speed.  
Of course, the same goes for old dogs. Last year, I had a faster walking speed with Pepper than today. The same round that we were able to walk relaxed within 20 minutes lasts 30-40 minutes today. Pepper just walks slower in general and also takes a lot more time to sniff around.  

Sometimes it happens to me too that I walk too fast for Pepper. I then realize that he can no longer walk relaxed and I slow down again. Something like that can of course happen, but it shouldn't be permanent!  

**In general, it is about paying attention to your dog and looking at which walking speed is comfortable for your dog. Your dog shouldn't have to run behind you with a taut leash, instead he should be able to walk relaxed. Note that the pleasant walking speed for your dog isnâ€™t automatically your own preferred walking speed, e.g. when you are walking without your dog!**
