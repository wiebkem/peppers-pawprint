The most common way is to give your dog some form of food. Instead of a treat, you can also reward your dog by smiling, running or playing together. A reward should always be positive and above all fun! A reward that makes your dog happy will also motivate him and you will remain interesting.  

When Pepper was young, I mostly rewarded him with a treat. Nowadays, he gets a smile, sometimes a treat or we just run for a short while. The reward depends on his physical condition and also the energy that I want to generate.  
Activity such as running or playing can also cause other reactions in your dog. Always keep this in mind and act accordingly!

## How do I reward my dog correctly?
Imagine you give your dog the command to lie down and he lies down. Now you want to reward him for it and you give him the treat when he's almost back into the sit position. Like this, your dog learns that he is rewarded for getting into the sit position rather than for lying down.  

When it comes to rewarding your dog, timing matters! That means that if you want to reward your dog for lying down, he should still be lying down when he receives the reward. This is especially important if your dog is still learning the command, as the command is not yet associated with the action.

## How does the reward remain exciting?
To keep the reward exciting, vary the strength of the treat (e.g. 2 treats or a whole handful) and the different types of rewards (like treats, smile, play, run).  

Find out what your dog enjoys. For example, if he likes to work with his nose, you can also do search games together as a reward, such as for a successful recall.
