The snuffle mat can be used indoors or in the garden. Preferable you have small treats that can be hidden at different places inside the mat. Once you placed all treats, the dog is allowed to search for it.

Maybe your dog is very excited in the beginning. If the snuffle mat is moving a lot, you can hold it so that your dog has it a bit easier. Additionally, it is important to place the treats not to deep inside the mat as it would be too difficult for your dog. The degree of difficulty should be increased slowly.

An alternative to a snuffle mat is just normal searching for treats. You can hide treats at different places inside the house or garden. At the beginning, the treats should be placed on the ground. Once you want to increase the difficulty you can also place the treats a little higher, e.g. on a chair.

**While hiding the treats, use your imagination. Just keep in mind that the dog should have fun and the task shouldn't be repeated too often. Nose work is very exhausting!**
