A rest and exercise diary provides insight into how long your dog sleeps during the day and how often your dog is challenged. To make the journal meaningful, answer the following questions.

## Ask for walks
- When did you walk your dog? (Write down all walks.)
- How long have you been on the road?
- How long was your dog on a leash and loose / on a long leash?
- What have you done with your dog along the way (eg search games or other activities)?

## Questions for the home
- How long does your dog sleep in the house?
- Do you keep your dog busy at home?
 - If so, how long do you keep your dog busy?
 - What do you do with your dog at home (eg search games)?
- Do you have a garden?
 - If so, how long was your dog there?
 - What has your dog done in the yard?

## Practical example
A 4-month-old bitch was adopted by friends. After a while, however, the bitch began to bite people's feet. This can of course have various causes, but without seeing it, no dog trainer can give tips!  

There was no direct answer to the question of how much the dog is challenged. I then gave the tip to write a rest and exercise diary. The above questions have been answered in the diary.  

With the help of the diary, the family could solve the problem all by themselves. They realized that the dog needed more of a challenge. The problem of biting the feet has completely disappeared without working on the problem itself. Such a diary can also help a dog trainer, because a behavioral problem must always be viewed in its entirety.
