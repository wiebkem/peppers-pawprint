A rest and exercise diary provides insight into how long your dog sleeps during the day and how often your dog exercises. To make it meaningful, you should answer the following questions.

## Ask for walks
- When did you walk your dog? (Write down all walks.)
- How long have you been walking?
- How long was your dog on a leash and loose / on a long leash?
- What have you done with your dog along the way (eg searching for threats or other activities)?

## Questions for at home
- How long does your dog sleep at home?
- What do you do with your dog inside the house (eg searching for threats) and for how long?
- Do you have a garden?
  - If yes, how long was your dog there?
  - What did your dog do inside the garden?

## Practical example
Friends adopted a dog was. After a while, the dog began to bite people's feet. This can of course have various causes, but without seeing it, no dog trainer can give any tips!  

Nobody was able to give an answer to the question how long the dog sleeps during the day and how often the dog exercises. I gave the tip to write a rest and exercise diary. The above questions have been answered in the diary.  

With the help of the diary, the family could solve the problem all by themselves. They realized that the dog needed more exercise. The problem of biting people's feet has completely disappeared without working on the problem itself. Such a diary can also help a dog trainer, because a behavioural problem should always be considered holistically.
