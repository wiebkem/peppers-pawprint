description = "Every dog gets old at some point and has more or less minor problems. Still it feels like it happened suddenly. Yesterday we had hours of adventures and today we walk slowly through the forest, always enjoying the peace."

Such a process is slow, of course, but it makes me realize that our common path is not endless. Sometimes after getting up, Pepper staggers a bit and has to find his balance in the hip. That's part of it, especially since his hip isn't his strongest side.  

We are taking day by day and adjust our daily walks according to how he feels. If I see that he is stiff, I am going for shorter walks and we relax more at home. This gives him the chance to be active and to go for longer walks on his better days üêæ  

Small walks for me take about 10 minutes at normal walking speed. However, when I walk with Pepper, we go very slowly so that he has enough time to sniffle. We also rest in between and e.g. just sit down in the grass. Then a 10 min walk quickly becomes 30 min.  

For the past six months, we have also been using the elevator daily. We live on the first floor and it is no longer so easy for Pepper to walk the stairs. That is why we always take the elevator and only use the stairs in exceptional cases.  

## Commands for an old dog
A few weeks ago, we were at my  parent‚Äôs place and their young dog got a treat for sitting. Of course, Pepper got one too - just because he looked adorable. Back in the days, I used to let him sit as well. Nowadays he just gets a treat for being adorable and I don't care if he actually just sits after saying it for the third time. That's the way it is and as an older dog I no longer emphasize it.  

## Memories
Especially during the last few days, I was thinking about the time when it will be time to say goodbye. I asked myself the question: ‚ÄòWhich memories do I want to have made?'.
First of all, I decided to book a photo shoot for both of us. I would like to have beautiful photos of us together as a memory. In two weeks, the time has come and I'm really looking forward to it üíï
