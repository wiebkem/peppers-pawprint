There are different ways on how to reward your dog. The most common way is to give your dog some food. Instead of giving him something to eat, you can also smile at him, start for a run or play together. Another reward is to let your dog off leash as it is a privilege for a dog.

When Pepper was young, I mostly rewarded him with a snack. Nowadays, he gets a smile, sometimes a snack or we just run for a short while. The reward depends on his physical condition and also the energy that I want to create üêæ
