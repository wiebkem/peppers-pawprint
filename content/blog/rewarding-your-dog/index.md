There are different ways on how to reward your dog. The most common way is to give your dog some food. Instead of giving him something to eat, you can also smile at him, start for a run or play together. Another reward is to let your dog off leash as it is a privilege for a dog.

When Pepper was young, I mostly rewarded him with a snack. Nowadays, he gets a smile, sometimes a snack or we just run for a short while. The reward depends on his physical condition and also the energy that I want to create üêæ

## How do I reward my dog correctly?
Imagine you give your dog the command to lie down and he lies down. Now you want to reward him for it and you give him the treat when he's almost back into the sit position. Like this, your dog learns that he is rewarded for getting into the sit position rather than for lying down.  

When it comes to rewarding your dog, timing is important! That means, if you want to reward your dog for lying down, he has to be in that position when he receives the reward.
