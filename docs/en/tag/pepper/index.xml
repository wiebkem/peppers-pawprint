      <description>Birthday: 08.04.2009 Gender: Male Breed: Shepherd-Collie-Mix 🐶 Leisure: We started mantrailing at the age of 10 and he loves it! 💞In general, he loves to work with his nose or working together with me. For this reason we often work with sniff games or we develop new tricks with the clicker. If Pepper has the opportunity, he also likes to look out of the window. At the moment, all windows in the apartment are a little higher and therefore he uses the balcony.</description>
