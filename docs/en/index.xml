        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am glad that you have found us! üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I would like to let you participate in our journey üõ§Ô∏è and to report on interesting topics in everyday dog life üê∂. You will also read more about traveling with a dog and why I started a dog trainer education üêï. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;get-to-know-pepper&#34;&gt;Get to know Pepper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birthday:&lt;/strong&gt; üéÇ08.04.2009&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Gender:&lt;/strong&gt; Male&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Breed:&lt;/strong&gt; Shepherd-Collie-Mix üê∂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;leisure&#34;&gt;Leisure:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started mantrailing at the age of 10 and he loves it! üíûIn general, he loves to work with his nose or working together with me. For this reason we often work with sniff games or we develop new tricks with the clicker.&lt;br&gt;
If Pepper has the opportunity, he also likes to look out of the window. At the moment, all windows in the apartment are a little higher and therefore he uses the balcony. In one of my earlier apartments my bed was in front of the window and, when I was not there, he was sitting comfortably on it and watching the world üòÇ (actually he isn&#39;t allowed to go on the bed&amp;hellip; otherwise I wouldn&#39;t have any space for myselfüôà).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;characteristics&#34;&gt;Characteristics:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he got to know and love ‚ù§Ô∏è a person, he literally goes crazy when that person visits. The visitor is then greeted wildly and, of course, it will be checked whether the person has something tasty for him.&lt;br&gt;
On a walk, Pepper thinks it&#39;s great to roll in the grass üåø. It became a standard procedure and cannot be left out during every walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to get to know more about Pepper or me, let me know! üòÅ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;DATA PROTECTION PROVISIONS ABOUT THE APPLICATION AND USE OF INSTAGRAM
On this website, the controller has integrated components of the service Instagram. Instagram is a service that may be qualified as an audiovisual platform, which allows users to share photos and videos, as well as disseminate such data in other social networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operating company of the services offered by Instagram is Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2 Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and on which an Instagram component (Insta button) was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to the download of a display of the corresponding Instagram component of Instagram. During the course of this technical procedure, Instagram becomes aware of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by the data subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Instagram, Instagram detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject‚Äîand for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site‚Äîwhich specific sub-page of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the Instagram component and is associated with the respective Instagram account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the Instagram buttons integrated on our website, then Instagram matches this information with the personal Instagram user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instagram receives information via the Instagram component that the data subject has visited our website provided that the data subject is logged in at Instagram at the time of the call to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on the Instagram button or not. If such a transmission of information to Instagram is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she can prevent this by logging off from their Instagram account before a call-up to our website is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Instagram may be retrieved under &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388&#34;&gt;https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/privacy/&#34;&gt;https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/privacy/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;8-data-protection-provisions-about-the-application-and-use-of-google-analytics&#34;&gt;8. Data Protection Provisions about the application and use of Google Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this website, the controller has integrated the component of Google Analytics (with the anonymizer function). Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website from which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed. Web analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a website and in order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ip-anonymization&#34;&gt;IP-Anonymization&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the web analytics through Google Analytics the controller uses the application ‚Äú_gat. _anonymizeIp‚Äù. By means of this application the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is abridged by Google and anonymised when accessing our websites from a Member State of the European Union or another Contracting State to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;auftragsdatenverarbeitung&#34;&gt;Auftragsdatenverarbeitung&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;datenschutzbereinkommen&#34;&gt;Datenschutz√ºbereinkommen&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;browser-plugin-zum-widerspruch-gegen-datenerfassung&#34;&gt;Browser Plugin zum Widerspruch gegen Datenerfassung&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data that are generated by Google Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such. For this purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on under the link &lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout&#34;&gt;https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout&lt;/a&gt; and install it. This browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google. If the information technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly installed, then the data subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics. If the browser add-on was uninstalled by the data subject or any other person who is attributable to their sphere of competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DATA PROTECTION PROVISIONS ABOUT THE APPLICATION AND USE OF GOOGLE ANALYTICS (WITH ANONYMIZATION FUNCTION)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our website. Google uses the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. The definition of cookies is explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website. With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google. During the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently create commission settlements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject. With each visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/&#34;&gt;https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/&lt;/a&gt; and under &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html&#34;&gt;https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html&lt;/a&gt;. Google Analytics is further explained under the following Link &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/analytics/&#34;&gt;https://www.google.com/analytics/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
