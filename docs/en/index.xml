&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-protection-provisions-about-the-application-and-use-of-instagram&#34;&gt;Data protection provisions about the application and use of Instagram&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this website, the controller has integrated components of the service Instagram. Instagram is a service that may be qualified as an audiovisual platform, which allows users to share photos and videos, as well as disseminate such data in other social networks.&lt;br&gt;
The operating company of the services offered by Instagram is Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2 Ireland.&lt;br&gt;
With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and on which an Instagram component (Insta button) was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to the download of a display of the corresponding Instagram component of Instagram. During the course of this technical procedure, Instagram becomes aware of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by the data subject.&lt;br&gt;
If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Instagram, Instagram detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site—which specific sub-page of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the Instagram component and is associated with the respective Instagram account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the Instagram buttons integrated on our website, then Instagram matches this information with the personal Instagram user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.&lt;br&gt;
Instagram receives information via the Instagram component that the data subject has visited our website provided that the data subject is logged in at Instagram at the time of the call to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on the Instagram button or not. If such a transmission of information to Instagram is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she can prevent this by logging off from their Instagram account before a call-up to our website is made.&lt;br&gt;
Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Instagram may be retrieved under &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388&#34;&gt;https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/privacy/&#34;&gt;https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/privacy/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-protection-provisions-about-the-application-and-use-of-facebook&#34;&gt;Data protection provisions about the application and use of Facebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this website, the controller has integrated components of the enterprise Facebook. Facebook is a social network.&lt;br&gt;
A social network is a place for social meetings on the Internet, an online community, which usually allows users to communicate with each other and interact in a virtual space. A social network may serve as a platform for the exchange of opinions and experiences, or enable the Internet community to provide personal or business-related information. Facebook allows social network users to include the creation of private profiles, upload photos, and network through friend requests.&lt;br&gt;
The operating company of Facebook is Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, United States. If a person lives outside of the United States or Canada, the controller is the Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.&lt;br&gt;
With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet website, which is operated by the controller and into which a Facebook component (Facebook plug-ins) was integrated, the web browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to download display of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook through the Facebook component. An overview of all the Facebook Plug-ins may be accessed under &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/&#34;&gt;https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/&lt;/a&gt;. During the course of this technical procedure, Facebook is made aware of what specific sub-site of our website was visited by the data subject.&lt;br&gt;
If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook, Facebook detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site—which specific sub-site of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the Facebook component and associated with the respective Facebook account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the Facebook buttons integrated into our website, e.g. the “Like” button, or if the data subject submits a comment, then Facebook matches this information with the personal Facebook user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.&lt;br&gt;
Facebook always receives, through the Facebook component, information about a visit to our website by the data subject, whenever the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook during the time of the call-up to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the data subject clicks on the Facebook component or not. If such a transmission of information to Facebook is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their Facebook account before a call-up to our website is made.&lt;br&gt;
The data protection guideline published by Facebook, which is available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://facebook.com/about/privacy/,&#34;&gt;https://facebook.com/about/privacy/,&lt;/a&gt; provides information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by Facebook. In addition, it is explained there what setting options Facebook offers to protect the privacy of the data subject. In addition, different configuration options are made available to allow the elimination of data transmission to Facebook. These applications may be used by the data subject to eliminate a data transmission to Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;google-analytics&#34;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our website. Google uses the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for us.&lt;br&gt;
Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. The definition of cookies is explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website. With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google. During the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently create commission settlements.&lt;br&gt;
The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject. With each visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.&lt;br&gt;
The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.&lt;br&gt;
Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/&#34;&gt;https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/&lt;/a&gt; and under &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html&#34;&gt;https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html&lt;/a&gt;. Google Analytics is further explained under the following Link &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/analytics/&#34;&gt;https://www.google.com/analytics/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
