      <description>A rest and exercise diary provides insight into how long your dog sleeps during the day and how often your dog exercises. To make it meaningful, you should answer the following questions.
Ask for walks  When did you walk your dog? (Write down all walks.) How long have you been walking? How long was your dog on a leash and loose / on a long leash? What have you done with your dog along the way (eg searching for threats or other activities)?</description>

      <description>Pepper is 11 years old now and we have never lived at the same address for a long time. We have tried many different living situations and I would like to share our experiences with you.
House with enclosed garden When Pepper moved in with us, I was still living at our family home in a house with an enclosed garden. I think a garden is very practical as you can just leave the patio door open in summer.</description>
