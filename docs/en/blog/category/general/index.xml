      <description>Pepper is 11 years old now and we have never lived at the same address for a long time. We have tried many different living situations and I would like to share our experiences with you.
House with enclosed garden When Pepper moved in with us, I was still living at our family home in a house with an enclosed garden. I think a garden is very practical as you can just leave the patio door open in summer.</description>
