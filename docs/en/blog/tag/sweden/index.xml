      <description>During the vacation week, we were at the Falun pit and saw the beautiful nature of the 3 national parks: Tresticklan, Fulufjället and Färnebofjärden. We did little hikes almost every day. Since it was very hot at the time of our tour, we were unfortunately unable to take long hikes. Some days we just rested at a lake - Pepper was sleeping and I read a book.
Practical things During wild camping, every place should be left as you found it.</description>

      <description>It has always been my dream to live in Sweden for a while and this dream came true for my master’s degree. Pepper and I spent a total of 1.5 years in Sweden.
Travel I can only talk about my experiences to travel to Sweden from Germany:
 You can drive through Denmark and then use the Öresund bridge between Copenhagen and Malmö. This bridge connects the two countries. It is easy to buy the tickets online so you don&#39;t have to queue in front of the bridge.</description>
