      "content": "Take an egg carton or shipping box and fill it with treats. Especially at the beginning it is probably too difficult for your dog to open the closed box. You can just close the box lightly. This makes it easier for your dog.\nOnce your dog dares to open the box, you can close the box completely in a later attempt. Just look at your dog and increase the difficulty accordingly!\nToilet paper or kitchen paper rolls can also be filled with treats - just fold the ends over. However, you should be careful with the roles that your dog does not eat them completely as this could happen in the beginning.\nHave fun with your dog!\n",

      "description": "Today I want to introduce the second enrichment - the hand puzzle. The hand puzzle is about the dog touching the hand with his nose or giving his paw and afterwards getting the reward.",
      "content": "To begin with, take one or multiple treats in your right hand and form a fist. The second hand should be flat besides it. Then the dog is allowed to come and smell on the right hand with the treats. As soon as the dog is touching the left hand with the nose, you can open the first to reward the dog.\nEspecially in the beginning, the dog probably tries to open the fist with the treats. You should ignore this. As soon as the dog understands to touch the hand, it is possible to place the two hands further away from each other. The distance of the hands should not be too far away, e.g. just a hand width, as the dog has to understand again that he should still touch the flat hand. Once the dog understands the action, the hands can be further moved from each other to increase the difficulty.\nPersonally, I trained Pepper to touch my left hand, if I have treats in the right hand. If I have treats in the left hand, he gives me his paw in my right hand. Before a dog is able to give a paw, the trick should be learned outside the hand puzzle!\nInside the family, the actions with the right and left hand should be the same for everyone. It's also possible to always get a nose touch or give the paw with both hands. Just keep in mind to not overdue it on a day so that the dog still has fun.\n",

      "description": "Currently, it is a difficult time for most of the people. While social distancing and probably a lockdown, there are lots of possibilities to do things with your dog indoors. At first, I want to introduce the snuffle mat and searching for treats.",
      "content": "The snuffle mat can be used indoors or in the garden. Preferable you have small treats that can be hidden at different places inside the mat. Once you placed all treats, the dog is allowed to search for it.\nMaybe your dog is very excited in the beginning. If the snuffle mat is moving a lot, you can hold it so that your dog has it a bit easier. Additionally, it is important to place the treats not to deep inside the mat as it would be too difficult for your dog. The degree of difficulty should be increased slowly.\nAn alternative to a snuffle mat is just normal searching for treats. You can hide treats at different places inside the house or garden. At the beginning, the treats should be placed on the ground. Once you want to increase the difficulty you can also place the treats a little higher, e.g. on a chair.\nWhile hiding the treats, use your imagination. Just keep in mind that the dog should have fun and the task shouldn't be repeated too often. Nose work is very exhausting!\n",

      "description": "I am feeding Pepper raw according to the Prey Model Raw concept. Why do I feed Pepper this way and what's in his bowl? Figure it out in this blog entry.",
      "content": "How do you feed your dog? What is right and what is wrong?\nIn the beginning, I just fed what most people feed - dry food. I thought this was good for Pepper and didn't think any further about it. This went well for a few years, 5 years to be exact. Then the problems started.\nIn December 2013, Pepper had an eczema on his tail that was a few centimetres long. For weeks, Pepper hadn't felt well, scratched himself day and night and just couldn't rest. Of course, we also went to the veterinarian a few times. The first time Pepper was treated for fleas, although he clearly had no fleas. After that he was treated with antibiotics and it took about 3 weeks until the eczema was finally gone and Pepper was able to find his peace again.\nA new problem started in January 2014. We had just beaten the eczema and Pepper suddenly had diarrhea and vomited. At that time, he was fed once a day in the evening. This meant that I went outside with him every two hours at night because he had such bad diarrhea and had to vomit all the time. Of course, I also checked this with a veterinarian, but it just didn't get any better. As long as he only ate the special diet, everything was fine and we could sleep through the night without problems. But as soon as I added only a handful of dry food, we were out every two hours. Certainly, this was not a condition that could go on permanently. Within a week, he had already lost 1.5 kg of weight. At the time, I was looking for alternatives to dry foot and came across BARF.\nStraight away, I started with BARF and Pepper was able to digest it. After a few weeks I discovered the Prey Model Raw concept. This appealed to me even more, because in this concept there are no vegetables or other additives. Pepper did not like the vegetables when we BARFed and had eaten them with reluctance. Within a couple of weeks, we switched directly from BARF to Prey Model Raw and have been really happy with this decision ever since. After 6 years we can say that we won't change and have found our diet.\nPrey Model Raw Concept The Prey Model Raw (PMR) concept is based on whole prey without any vegetable ingredients. If there is no way to feed whole prey, this is compiled based on the following breakdown:\n 80% Meat including fat 10% Bones 5% Liver 5% Other organs such as spleen or kidney  Pepper gets 3% of his ideal body weight. Young dogs might be fed between 5-6% of the body weight, because they have an increased need during their growth.\nMeat Meat is available from various animals. It is important to feed at least two (but preferably three) different types of red meat, e.g. beef, horse, sheep, lamb or goat. White meat should not be fed primarily (e.g. chicken, turkey, goose, etc.).\nIn general, the meat should have a fat content of 15-25% for the reason that fat provides the dog with important energy. If the meat has a low-fat content, it is important to add extra fat.\nI also feed the meat in large pieces, as this comes closest to a prey animal and in addition, the dog has to chew.\nBones Bones should always be fed with a lot of meat around it. The meat around the bones must then be subtracted from the 10% bones and added to the 80% meat. The 10% bones are therefore only the pure amount of bones.\nFor example, chicken necks have around 50% bones. To get the 10% pure bone amount, more than 10% of chicken necks have to be fed. The meat around the chicken necks is then deducted from the amount of bones and this meat portion is added to the amount of meat.\nIt is also important not to feed supporting bones as they are too hard for the dog and could injure him.\nFish oil Unless grass-fed or wild animals are mainly fed, it is important to add fish oil to the diet. Mast meat has too much omega-6 which must be balanced with the omega-3 in fish oil. Too much omega-6 can cause inflammation in the dog's body.\n",

      "content": "Domain de Chevetogne The Domaine de Chevetogne is a nature park with different attractions. In the summer months it is possible to swim or play tennis and kids can play on multiple playgrounds all the year.\nAdditionally, the park has different nature walking routes. Dogs are allowed on a leash and in the winter months you can visited the park for free.\nGrotte de Dinant La Merveilleuse The Grotte de Dinant La Merveilleuse is said to be one of the most beautiful caves in Belgium. A guided tour takes about one hour and you are allowed to bring your dog.\nPersonally, I have decided to leave Pepper at the holiday home. However, there were two dogs on our tour and this was not an issue. In case you want to take your dog, it should be noted that the dog has to walk quite some stairs.\nHan-Sur-Lesse In Han-Sur-Lesse there are several beautiful hiking trails from 7.7 km to 41 km from Trail en Famenne which start at the church. These walks are nature trails and lead through the forest as well as a few roads. We only discovered these hikes by accident and searched the internet a lot for a place where we can hike. These routes we can definitely recommend.\n",

      "description": "This blog entry is about the travel options to Sweden from Germany, the entry requirements for dogs and the national parks in Sweden.",
      "content": "It has always been my dream to live in Sweden for a while and this dream came true for my master’s degree. Pepper and I spent a total of 1.5 years in Sweden.\nTravel I can only talk about my experiences to travel to Sweden from Germany:\n You can drive through Denmark and then use the Öresund bridge between Copenhagen and Malmö. This bridge connects the two countries. It is easy to buy the tickets online so you don't have to queue in front of the bridge. A second possibility is the ferry crossing. There are ferries from e.g. Travemünde and Rostock in Germany to Trelleborg or from Kiel in Germany to Gothenburg. The most common ferries are the one from Stenaline and TT-Line. These go back and forth every day.\nOn the ferry you cannot stay inside the car, but most ferries have their own lounges for dogs.\nMany children run around during the day and it is generally very restless. At night you can sleep on the floor next to your dog if you don't have a pet cabin, and everything is calmer and more relaxed than during the day.\nThe ferry takes 6 to 7 hours. The pure crossing is about 6 hours, but you are usually loaded onto the ship a little earlier and it takes a little longer to unload. I always waited at a petrol station or rest area at the ferry port to let the dog out for the last time. After the crossing and unloading all cars, the first resting place was my point of interest to leave out the dog.  Personally, I decided not to travel from Germany to Sweden via Denmark, but to take the ferry. I made this choice as I drove the route alone. Additionally, I prefer the night ferries as I have the opportunity to sleep on the ferry.\nEntry requirements If you generally travel with your dog to another country, the dog needs a pet passport, a microchip and a valid rabies vaccination. Furthermore, there are no special entry requirements for Sweden.\nNational parks Dogs must be kept on a leash in all national parks in Sweden. This is to protect animals and nature. All information about the national parks can be found on the website National parks of Sweden. I usually kept Pepper on a long leash in the national parks which is 7.5 meters long. This way he had more freedom to move and was still leashed.\nFree running dogs outside the national parks The dog must be on a leash in the city area. Nevertheless, the dog is mostly allowed to run free in the forest. To be on the safe side, you should read the information board that says at which time of the year your dog can run freely in the forest.\nPublic transport Dogs can be taken on the public transport free of charge. There are special areas for dogs, which are mostly in the rear compartment, since in this case people with an allergy are protected in the front part. If you pay attention to these areas, it is very easy to use the public transport with your dog.\nAdditional information Additional information about things to do, facts and info you can also find on Visit Sweden.\n",
