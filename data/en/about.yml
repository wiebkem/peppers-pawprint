      content : "We started mantrailing at the age of 10 and he loves it! 💞In general, he loves to work with his nose or working together with me. For this reason, we often work with sniff games or we develop new tricks with the clicker.  
                
      
              If Pepper has the opportunity, he also likes to look out of the window. At the moment, all windows in the apartment are a little higher and therefore he uses the balcony. In one of my earlier apartments my bed was in front of the window and, when I was not there, he was sitting comfortably on it and watching the world 😂 (actually he isn't allowed to go on the bed... otherwise I wouldn't have any space for myself🙈)."

      content : "If he got to know and love ❤️ a person, he literally goes crazy when that person visits. The visitor is then greeted wildly and, of course, it will be checked whether the person has something tasty for him.  
                
      
              On a walk, Pepper thinks it's great to roll in the grass 🌿. It became a standard procedure and cannot be left out during every walk."
