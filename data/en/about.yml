      content : "During my childhood, we always had dogs and since I am 16 years old Pepper accompanies me.
          When I moved from home at the age of 19 and therefore from Germany to the Netherlands to study, Pepper naturally joined me.
          5 years later I went to Sweden for my Master education and at the moment I live with Pepper and my boyfriend again in the Netherlands."

      content : "Shortly before Pepper's 10th birthday we started with mantrailing. 
          I find it a great dog enrichment and Pepper loves it in particular as he likes to work with his nose. 
          For this reason, we do often different treats search games or we develop new tricks with the clicker 💞"
