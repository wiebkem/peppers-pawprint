nameContent : "**Why is the blog called Pepper's Pawprint?** Pepper is my first dog. I have had him for 11 years now and 
  we have experienced a lot together. Pepper has definitely left his mark, so to speak his paw prints. Because of him 
  I decided to start a dog instructor education and I hope that we have many more years together."
